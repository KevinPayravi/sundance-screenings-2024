When he loses his ninth life, fate steps in to set him on a transformative journey.
Writer-director Christopher Jenkins takes us on a fun and emotional adventure through the heterochromous eyes and many lives of the exuberant cat Beckett. Beautiful animation introduces us to a fantastic world where the powers of love and family are magical and persistent; where life itself is a challenge to care and be cared for by the ones we love. 
An all-star voice cast features Simone Ashley, Zayn Malik, Mo Gilligan, and Dylan Llewellyn — characters that are funny and full of heart, guiding us through a narrative that lovingly and with levity centers the transcendent bonds we have with our pets. At times silly and electric, and just as often a tearjerker, 10 Lives is perfect for audiences of all ages.—CA","Family Matinee, All Features, International, Animation, Comedy, Fiction, Suitable For All Ages, Closed Captioning, Open Caption, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fdd1fac9f4917fc03a15,A Different Man,Premieres,"Aspiring actor Edward undergoes a radical medical procedure to drastically transform his appearance. But his new dream face quickly turns into a nightmare, as he loses out on the role he was born to play and becomes obsessed with reclaiming what was lost.
Writer-director Aaron Schimberg’s latest film is a surreal, singular tale of one man’s desire to self-actualize. Sebastian Stan is Edward, a man overcome by the reality of his appearance, intent on curing his alienation and transcending his self- and socially enforced artistic potential. Adam Pearson and Renate Reinsve carefully embody foils to Edward’s ambition, an artistic and philosophical juxtaposition of his, and our, conceits. 
Through a haunting score, Lynchian approach to story, and folkloric magical realism, a unique psychological thriller emerges. A stylish vision of the theatrical currents of New York stages a universe where reality and fiction blend in beautiful ways; where lies, expectations, and internal turmoil weave a man’s consequentially incipient senses of truth and becoming. A Different Man is a reflexive allegory for the modern tortured artist, a subversive, gothic fairytale that deftly begets obsession.—CA

Silje Evensmo Jacobsen’s portrait of the Payne family is an intimate encounter with a family coming to terms with a new reality. For years, the family of six enjoyed a slower-paced, independent life in harmony with nature on a picturesque farm. Now they are at a turning point, and Jacobsen captures their journey with a caring eye. The vulnerability and compassion they extend to each other, the land, and their animals are tenderly and beautifully observed by a camera that feels part of the family, while home videos woven throughout provide meaningful insights into years past. Joyous moments spring through the heartache, and the Paynes’ strong bond and love for each other guide them through each challenge they face. Jacobsen crafts a sensitive, affectionate, and completely heartfelt experience that is as much about navigating grief as it is about graciously accepting change.—SO

The adventure takes a turn when the pair’s old tensions resurface against the backdrop of their family history.
Writer-director Jesse Eisenberg (When You Finish Saving the World, 2022 Sundance Film Festival) returns to the Festival with a poignant, funny exploration of the unexpected permutations of intergenerational trauma. Eisenberg’s intimate, resonant script complements the tension and humor of the two very different cousins’ tumultuous road trip with a sensitively drawn reckoning of the legacy of World War II among the survivors of survivors.
While Benji’s irreverent charm only partially masks his deep melancholy, David’s frustration with and genuine love for his cousin become achingly clear. Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin give devastating, funny performances as characters grappling with their grandmother’s history and the ways their own lives have diverged. Michał Dymek’s eloquent cinematography and a Chopin-driven score bind the tour group’s complicated, emotional reaction to the Polish setting into the texture of the film.—HZ

But will he find his own along the way?
Agent of Happiness, directed by Arun Bhattarai and Dorottya Zurbó, offers a unique take on the notoriously exoticized Bhutan and its unusual happiness policy. We follow Amber as he investigates various expressions of contentment across different households and lifestyles while navigating his own struggle as a Nepali minority. The holistic philosophy at the heart of the survey he conducts challenges the conventional metrics of fulfillment and success, often provoking some deeper soul-searching. The filmmakers elegantly capture many tender moments between Amber and his interlocutors, as well as some very revealing conversations filled with unflinching honesty and quiet wisdom.
Through its carefully crafted narrative, the film resonates as a heartfelt exploration of happiness in the face of adversity. As Amber grapples with societal disparities and personal roadblocks while searching for love, this story becomes a beautifully realized reminder to count our blessings.—AT

As filmmakers Sam & Andy demonstrate in their wildly imaginative debut feature, telling the love story of a smart buoy and an orbiting satellite that spans a billion years and probes the mysteries of being and consciousness requires legit storytelling dexterity. Love Me's whimsically philosophical, shape-shifting structure ingeniously weaves together the real, the virtual, and the surreal. Its star-crossed, web-paired metallic protagonists — inhabited in different forms by Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun — awkwardly navigate romance and companionship, equipped only with untold petabytes of archived web data, social media, and online videos. Awash in these mediated experiences and fabricated expressions of love and identity, they yearn to understand who they are, whether their feelings are real, and for that matter, whether they are real.—JN

In a collective act of joy as a form of resistance, hope flickers against the backdrop of increasing autocracy.
With the end of Rodrigo Duterte’s presidency and his attacks on democratic institutions like a free independent press, some Filipinos hoped for a new beginning. In contrast, others yearned for even more autocracy and a return to an era before the People Power Revolution and the restoration of democracy just a generation before. In this companion piece to A Thousand Cuts, which helped introduce the world to online news site Rappler and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa, director Ramona Diaz returns to Sundance with a film that takes you inside the fight for democracy in the modern media age. As elections threaten to be simulacrums of democratic processes, And So It Begins chronicles what the defenders of democracy in the Philippines have experienced and is a haunting depiction of what is at stake in elections around the world.—SS

J.M. Harper’s self-assured directorial debut unfolds like an original odyssey, shedding light on the intersection between the weaponization of rap lyrics and threats to freedom of speech. Traveling with Kemba grounds the international exploration in the perspective of an artist. He guides us through the origins of gangster rap to drill, studies on racial bias in music, discussions with legal experts, and candid conversations with influential artists like Killer Mike to reveal a profound history of targeting Black music and artists. Harper’s seamless transitioning between restructured interviews, animated sequences, and imaginative reenactments reveals an audacious vision that also reflects the depth and interconnectedness of the issues at hand. Harper’s sophisticated and immersive journey merges style and substance, boldly weaving through a web of issues, and ultimately shining a light on the First Amendment, provoking crucial questions about whom it protects.—SO

It features a soundscape and movement informed by a dataset from Black communities, theorists, poets, and activists, including bell hooks, Paulo Freire, Dazié Grego-Sykes, and Cornel West. 
Being (the Digital Griot) is a machine learning model run by a counterhegemonic algorithm that multidisciplinary artist Rashaad Newsome has been developing since 2019. Being (the Digital Griot) takes the humanoid form of a 30-foot tall, femme vogue Afro-futurist cyborg, who writes and reads poetry, and leads critical pedagogy workshops that teach people to decolonize their minds. Colonial values of extraction and exploitation live ubiquitously inside the hearts and minds of colonial subjects, and are the root of our unconscious compulsion to dehumanize and extract value from each other, and from our planet. Being offers generous ways of forging relationships — with others and with ourselves. Newsome reminds us that AI is powered by the richness of our collective human archive, and is a reflection of the values of the designer.—SF","New Frontier, All Features, Fiction, Open Caption, U.S. Only","LEAD ARTIST:

Having premiered an Academy Award–nominated documentary feature (Murderball) and an animated short (My Biodegradable Heart) at the Festival, director Dana Adam Shapiro returns with Better Angels: The Gospel According To Tammy Faye, a lively, ruminative documentary series that provides fresh insights into the life of American icon Tammy Faye Messner. A larger-than-life personality whose singular visage became a cultural touchstone, Messner and her personal breakthroughs — both high and low — were reflected in the political, religious, and societal news of the day. Shapiro adroitly excavates private and historical artifacts to craft a profile that distinctively centers Messner as the leading woman of her own story.—DC

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569ff92fac9f427abc03c60,Black Box Diaries,World Cinema Documentary Competition,"Journalist Shiori Ito embarks on a courageous investigation of her own sexual assault in an improbable attempt to prosecute her high-profile offender. Her quest becomes a landmark case in Japan, exposing the country’s outdated judicial and societal systems.
Black Box Diaries was born out of Ito’s need to document her investigation — a response to the authorities’ refusal to pursue her case in a meaningful manner. More importantly, it was a way to journal her fears and thoughts as she anticipated the backlash that followed. 
As the film’s director, Ito accomplishes something remarkable. On one hand, Black Box Diaries has a raw and honest quality to it — it’s a personal journey from the perspective of a victim piecing together the crime she experienced, while pushing herself to the extreme. At the same time, it is an impressively crafted, concise piece of filmmaking — guided by a strong sense of purpose and broken up by occasional moments of joy. Shiori Ito came forward to challenge her high-profile abuser despite knowing the risks. Her bravery meant hope for others and the prospect of real change to a broken system.—AT

In his feature debut, writer and director Jianjie Lin elegantly unfurls a story where, just under the surface of family dinners, polite manners, and daily school and extracurricular activities, lie dark truths and hidden yearnings threatening to explode into sight.

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a039efac9f485fbc04459,Daughters,U.S. Documentary Competition,"Four young girls prepare for a special Daddy Daughter Dance with their incarcerated fathers, as part of a unique fatherhood program in a Washington, D.C., jail.
A moving lesson in empathy and forgiveness, Daughters is a result of an eight-year documentary journey that filmmaker Natalie Rae and Angela Patton, an activist advocating for “at-promise” girls, embarked upon. As Aubrey, Santana, Raziah, and Ja’Ana get ready for the special event, they speak candidly about their hopes, dreams, and disappointments. There is an innate wisdom and honesty to what they share about their dads’ inconsistent presence; an awareness far beyond their years. Daughters meaningfully challenges many stereotypes around incarceration and serves as a poignant reminder that maintaining family bonds can be both healing and empowering. We get to witness a lot of joy, but in keeping with the film’s vérité style, Rae and Patton don’t shy away from more challenging moments, including heartbreak, skepticism, reluctance to engage, and anger. But then comes a classic dad joke, and the mood shifts again.—AT

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569ff57fac9f47e28c03bfb,Desire Lines,NEXT,"Past and present collide when an Iranian American trans man time-travels through an LGBTQ+ archive on a dizzying and erotic quest to unravel his own sexual desires.
Leading trans academic and scholar Jules Rosskam makes his Sundance debut with this daring, sexy exploration of the interdependence of gender expression and sexuality. Deploying a hybrid approach, Rosskam blends a deeply intellectual interrogation of the archive, a sharp erotic imagination, and a series of breathtakingly intimate interviews to create this layered document of transmasculine sexuality and its profoundly social roots and ripples.
Executive producer (and frequent advisor to the Sundance Institute’s Native Labs) Jennifer Reeder returns to Sundance after her 2015 short A Million Miles Away. Lead performers Theo Germaine (of 2019 Sundance Film Festival Indie Episodic breakout Work in Progress) and Aden Hakimi share a cerebral and physical chemistry that enlivens and enriches this examination. Desire Lines is an urgently needed contribution to a sociopolitical landscape in desperate need of empathy, understanding, levity, and freedom.—AH

Leave it to acclaimed filmmaker Chris Smith (American Movie) to perfectly capture the gloriously radical spirit that is Devo. This high-energy documentary embraces the spectacle of the band reveling in lofi archival footage, swift montage, and a charging rhythm that leaves you mesmerized by their wild rise. Band members are open with both their memories and archives — finally sharing their full story. They are a rare band founded by a philosophy; a Dada experiment of high art meets low, hellbent on infiltrating American popular culture, and DEVO relishes every freakish moment of their story. Not to mention all the incredible performances.—CS

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6573b60a8c1a1f50e501b34b,DIG! XX,40th Edition Celebration Screenings and Events,"Dig! XX tracks the tumultuous rise of two talented musicians, Anton Newcombe, leader of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and Courtney Taylor, leader of the Dandy Warhols, and dissects their star-crossed friendship and bitter rivalry. Through their loves and obsessions, gigs and recordings, arrests and death threats, uppers and downers, and ultimately to their chance at a piece of the profit-driven music business, they stage a self-proclaimed revolution in the music industry. 
Originally seven years in the making, and culled from 2,500 hours of footage, Ondi Timoner's Dig! gets a 20th-anniversary refresh, featuring 35 minutes of previously unseen footage. Fresh, stylish, raucous, and raw, Dig! XX is a feat in rough-and-tumble filmmaking, but the conflicts it examines are as old as Mozart. Where does genius fit into a commodified world? Can it thrive and get its due, or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity? Being at the right place at the right time is what makes Dig! XX important, but being in the wrong place, like in the path of a flying mike stand, is what makes it exhilarating.
DIG! premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival in the U.S. Documentary Competition, where it ultimately won the Grand Jury Prize in the documentary category. DIG! XX, which will premiere at the upcoming Festival, is not only a digitally enhanced, remixed, and remastered version of DIG!, but also a special 20th anniversary new edit of the film culled from footage shot over seven years, and brought to you by the original sibling team, Ondi and David Timoner.

In his striking directorial debut, Sean Wang takes us on a kinetic ride through the ups and downs of adolescence, mining personal experience to share a joyful, funny, and deeply affecting ode to first-generation teenagers navigating the beauty and pain of cultural heritage in a sea of conformity. Wang confidently steers us through the freewheeling early days of social media, where AIM emoticons and MySpace rankings carry the weight of heartbreak and friendships forged and broken. Both a moving love letter to immigrant parents and a playful examination of our uncertain paths to adulthood, Dìdi (弟弟) reminds us that growing up and growing into better versions of ourselves are often one and the same.—AS

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a2d56fac9f46c9bc071a3,Eno,New Frontier,"Visionary musician and artist Brian Eno — known for producing David Bowie, U2, Talking Heads, among many others; pioneering the genre of ambient music; and releasing over 40 solo and collaboration albums — reveals his creative processes in this groundbreaking generative documentary: a film that’s different every time it’s shown.
Filmmaker Gary Hustwit brings to the Sundance Film Festival the first career-spanning documentary about visionary musician and artist Brian Eno. This innovative bio-doc also elevates the documentary form to become an evergreen, algorithmic performance.
Hustwit and creative technologist Brendan Dawes have developed a bespoke generative software designed to sequence scenes and create transitions out of Hustwit’s original interviews with Eno, and Eno’s rich archive of hundreds of hours of never-before-seen footage, and unreleased music. Each screening of Eno is unique, presenting different scenes, order, music, and meant to be experienced live.
The generative and infinitely iterative quality of Eno poetically resonates with the artist’s own creative practice, his methods of using technology to compose music, and his endless deep dive into the mercurial essence of creativity.—SF","New Frontier, All Features, Biography, Music Films, Science & Technology, Experimental, Nonfiction, Suitable For All Ages, Closed Captioning, English Subtitles, Open Caption, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

An exploration of a profound human desire and the consequences of turning the dream of immortality into a product.
“I wanted to see if he was okay,” explains Christi, one of the users of Project December. With this innovative software, users can communicate with a virtual version of the deceased through a chatbot that simulates the dead person’s conversation patterns. Hers was an attempt to check on her first love. Others may simply miss someone, seek permission to move on, or want to rid themselves of guilt. 
Little is known about the effects that this kind of generative AI might have on our brains, hearts, and wallets. The filmmakers, Hans Block and Moritz Riesewieck (The Cleaners, 2018 Sundance Film Festival), do not claim to have the answers, but instead bring up various emotional and moral complexities we should be aware of. Eternal You poses important questions about algorithmic immortality, and the need to take a closer look at our future “digital remains.”—AT

A film of joy and wonder, EVERY LITTLE THING offers profound truths in a deceptively simple story. What does it mean to care for another, and what impact does this act have on us? In tending to these fragile yet resilient hummingbirds, Terry Masear finds a sense of healing from her own past. Her diminutive patients — brought into sharp focus through breathtaking, beautifully detailed photography — become memorable protagonists in their own right. The viewer becomes emotionally invested in Cactus, Jimmy, Wasabi, Alexa, and Mikhail, celebrating their small victories and lamenting their tiny tragedies. The compassion and empathy that Masear shows her Lilliputian charges serves as a lesson to us all — a reminder that in the smallest of acts, and in the tiniest of creatures, we might find grace.—BT

Together, they learn that forgetting might be a greater challenge than forgiving.
This soulful, sophisticated, and beautifully crafted debut feature blossoms a hard-to-tell story about destructive parenting, the seasons of angst weathered by an abused child becoming a successful human being, and the deep meaning and salve of creative practice. 
Oscar-shortlisted filmmaker and celebrated painter Titus Kaphar turns his attention again to cinema to innovate a fresh cinematic language that incorporates the language of paint and canvas to tells the story of Tarrell (André Holland), an art star reckoning with his own traumatic childhood by creating powerful and transcendent paintings.
At the radiant heart of Exhibiting Forgiveness is Tarell’s artistic process, which illuminates how a creative practice can redeem illnesses of the soul, forge pathways toward regaining power over one’s own destiny, and forgive and transform despite the spiritual damage.—SF

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fe3cfac9f47946c03a61,Freaky Tales,Premieres,"In 1987 Oakland, a mysterious force guides The Town’s underdogs in four interconnected tales: Teen punks defend their turf against Nazi skinheads, a rap duo battles for hip-hop immortality, a weary henchman gets a shot at redemption, and an NBA All-Star settles the score. Basically another day in the Bay.
Since premiering their short Gowanus, Brooklyn at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden have forged careers marked by fresh story sensibilities, rigorous character complexities, and outstanding performances. A mind-blowing mixtape and joyful ode to the ’80s, Freaky Tales imaginatively fuses styles and cinematic influences with giddy abandon, yielding a pastiche of pulp, pop, comic books, anthology horror, Old Testament wrath, and kung fu by way of a bloody crescendo that leaves no appendage unsevered. The supernatural storm brewing above Oakland empowers its ensemble of underdog warriors with a spirit of righteous retribution as they take on bullies, corruption, racism, misogyny, the Man, and the Lakers. A stirring anthem to solidarity and Oakland’s egalitarian, countercultural, and multicultural spirit, Freaky Tales reminds a world of wrongdoing that this is what you get when you mess with the underdogs — after all, there are more of us.—JN

Told through her own words for the very first time — drawn from her diary, revealing letters, essays, and print interviews — and brought vividly to life by lyrical animation inspired by her unforgettable artwork.
Carla Gutiérrez, renowned for her masterful editing of films including Sundance Film Festival projects RBG (2018), When Two Worlds Collide (2016), and Cesar’s Last Fast (2014), brings artistry and a deep understanding of her subject to an astonishing directorial debut. Through a cacophony of rich archival sights, music, and journal entries joyfully brought to life, we become immersed in Frida’s interior world, fears, arduous relationships, and events that drove her indelible artistic creations. Gutiérrez vibrantly guides us through Frida’s complex relationship to her own work, navigating the tension between art as commerce and painting for pleasure and self-knowledge. With reverence, thoughtfulness, and the color of pure emotion, FRIDA invites us to get to know one of the greatest artists of the 20th century in a completely new way.—AS

Gaucho Gaucho paints an Argentinian Western with image and sound that reach an operatic beauty. Acclaimed photographers and now three-time Sundance-fêted filmmakers Gregory Kershaw and Michael Dweck return with another striking nonfiction work after first taking audiences to the final stock car racetrack of Long Island with The Last Race and the secret corners of the Italian countryside in search of white truffles with The Truffle Hunters. Their focus is now on the vast plains of Argentina, expressed in stunning black-and-white photography, and a small community of gauchos who hold profound connections to the surrounding nature and their own traditions. As older generations dispense their wisdom, the film keeps its eye toward a new generation who continue to fight for their families’ legacy in a modern world.—CS

Alex Thompson and Kelly O'Sullivan’s moving, gently comic collaboration is about the power of live theater to make sense of our offstage dramas and personal narratives. Ghostlight centers on Dan (Keith Kupferer), a melancholic middle-aged construction worker grieving a family tragedy. Cut off from his devoted wife, Sharon (Tara Mallen), and talented but troubled daughter, Daisy (Katherine Mallen Kupferer), Dan finds comfort and community in a misfit company of amateur actors. While moonlighting in a low-rent production of Shakespeare’s most protean tragedy, Dan is forced to confront his buried emotions. Real-life family Mallen, Kupferer, and Mallen Kupferer bring tenderness and authenticity to this poignant portrait, while Dolly de Leon — last seen stealing the scene in Triangle of Sadness — is hilarious as Dan’s irascible, improbable co-star.—MC","Premieres, All Features, Comedy, Drama, Fiction, Closed Captioning, Open Caption, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss’ anticipated return to the captivating world of teenage-led politics follows ambitions unfolding as hundreds of teenage girls gather to build a representative government in Missouri during a session of Girls State co-hosted alongside Boys State. As the girls run for office, including governor and supreme court seats, they also methodically preside over a reproductive rights case while the real-life overturning of Roe v. Wade hangs in the balance. McBaine and Moss stay embedded in Girls State, following several charismatic candidates, but these aspiring change-makers keenly take note of the Boys State program, and the differences between the programs, sparking outcry and awakening.Girls State deftly reflects urgent issues around gender equality and our political landscape through the energetic and tenacious lens of youth. The candidates’ resilience and adaptability shine through, revealing that no closed doors are stopping these girls.—SO","Premieres, All Features, Women-Centered Stories, Nonfiction, Audio Description, Closed Captioning, Open Caption, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

But her sexual, rebellious awakening is disrupted by her mother who never got to come of age herself. 
With precision and sensitivity, first-time feature director Shuchi Talati invites us into the lives of characters she intimately understands and deciphers, allowing us to experience adolescent sexual discovery with all its conflicting emotions. Preeti Panigrahi embodies Mira with nuanced sincerity, her hesitation transforming into confidence when she’s swept up by Kesav Binoy Kiron’s charismatic, wry Sri. Kani Kusruti, meanwhile, gives a brilliant performance as Mira’s cunning mother, Anila, setting up the perfect game of mother-daughter chess as these women descend into a struggle that threatens their affection for each other. Beautifully exploring the origins of empowerment and the limits of trust, Girls Will Be Girls celebrates the freedom of self-acceptance and the solace of female agency, sensuality, and physicality.—AS

Her roommate, Kia, already has it in the person of Evy, who lives at home with her mom while still trying to shake off her ex-husband. Then there's Ely, Kia's ex-student who is seemingly available. Ely shares a place with Daria, the quintessential lesbian about town, constantly in and out of women's beds and hearts. Kia thinks Max would like Ely; Daria thinks Ely should like Max. Everyone schemes. We're treated to a date, a dinner party, pride, honor, friendship, laundry, nail clipping — and, of course, sex.
Rose Troche’s debut feature serves as an insider view of lesbian life in the ’90s, crafted by a creative team as skillful at portraying angst as irony. Dubbed upon its release as a queer Slacker for its low-budget, black-and-white chronicling of daily hopes, fears, and banalities, Go Fish begins where coming-out films used to end: All the women are gay, and sex is on everybody's mind. At once gritty and lyrical, it tracks an interlinked cast of characters through a fanciful girl-meets-girl saga.Go Fish was digitally restored by the Academy Film Archive and UCLA Film & Television Archive in conjunction with Sundance Institute in 4K from the original 16mm A/B camera negatives and 35mm magnetic soundtrack. The restoration was funded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Amazon MGM Studios, Frameline, Sundance Institute, and UCLA Film & Television Archive.

India Donaldson’s intimate feature debut deploys a deceptively simple narrative imbued with poetry and humor to wrestle with weighty truths about teenage girlhood. Capturing the pristine serenity of the natural beauty of the film’s setting via Wilson Cameron’s delicate cinematography, Good One artfully crystallizes how the men’s competitive friction overtakes Sam’s experience of even the most tranquil landscape.
As her father’s paternalistic focus on his wayward friend leaves little space for Sam, Lily Collias crisply conveys her character’s discomfort and changing estimation of their relationship through subtle shifts in expression and body language, allowing the audience to consider alongside her the cost of her obedience. As Chris and Matt, James Le Gros and Danny McCarthy inject the film with tension and uneasy humor, providing context and atmosphere in support of Donaldson’s intricate exploration of the lessons Sam learns.—HZ

Three families faced with loss try to figure out what this resurrection means and if their loved ones really are back. Based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist.
Reuniting Renate Reinsve and Anders Danielsen Lie (The Worst Person in the World, 2022 Sundance Film Festival), Handling the Undead is a visually expansive experience, full of arresting images and subtle performances that collapse the space between the living and the dead. Director Thea Hvistendahl’s steady directorial hand leaves her characters room to breathe, to mediate the moral gray area, letting the minutiae of grief lead them as they feel their way through an extraordinary circumstance. Hvistendahl’s interpretation of Lindqvist’s novel addresses daunting questions about the body, the soul, loss, and moving on, pushing viewers to get to the root of reanimation: What would you do, and how would you feel, if someone you loved returned?—AE

He meets his match in a client who steals his heart and ignites a powder keg of deception, delight, and mixed-up identities. Inspired by an unbelievable true story.
In Richard Linklater’s enjoyable comedy noir, Hit Man, which premiered at the 2023 Venice Film Festival, Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) might at first seem like a geeky philosophy professor — and he most certainly is one. But don’t be fooled by his scholarly appearance, quiet life, and cats named Id and Ego. There are many sides to Gary’s personality, thanks to Powell’s and Linklater’s witty script — and arguably, the former’s most versatile and charming performance to date.  
Gary’s shape-shifting life is turned upside down by a meet-cute with a damsel in distress. But just as with the character of Gary, under layers of physical comedy and goofy humor, Linklater plants questions about identity and self, as well as the idea that, to some extent, we are all performing our roles.—AT","Spotlight, All Features, Comedy, N/A, Nonfiction, Romance, Audio Description, Closed Captioning, Open Caption, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a0186842a921956cd365c,How to Have Sex,Spotlight,"Three British teenage girls go on a rite-of-passage holiday, drinking, clubbing, and hooking up in what should be the best summer of their lives. As they dance their way across the sun-drenched streets of Malia, they find themselves navigating the complexities of sex, consent, and self-discovery.
While the girls seem initially equally captivated by the nonstop bacchanal, the film’s increasing focus on bubbly, inexperienced Tara — who carefully reconsiders her vacation, her friendships, and herself after a questionably consensual late-night encounter on the beach — turns an incisive viewing experience into a searingly unforgettable one. In her feature debut, Molly Manning Walker embeds a devastatingly honest examination of sexuality and consent within a multifaceted portrait of female friendship, all set against the backdrop of a vivid rendering of alcohol-fueled party culture.  
Manning Walker’s script deftly captures her young protagonists’ complicated bond, imparting vulnerabilities and jealousies in dialogue that never feels less than fully authentic. Actress Mia McKenna-Bruce allows us extraordinary access into Tara’s constantly shifting emotional state, unmistakably imparting her character’s unvoiced trauma and confusion.—HZ

In the pale glow of the television, Owen’s view of reality begins to crack.
Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun’s We’re All Going to the World’s Fair (2021 Sundance Film Festival) introduced us to a new genre of their own design: emo horror. Their follow-up feature builds upon that vibe, worming its way into the subconscious with an equally potent autopsy of reality versus fiction. As Owen, Justice Smith exudes a quiet vulnerability, while co-lead Brigette Lundy-Paine displays a confident yet awkward conviction. Schoenbrun has a knack for portraying the trappings of adolescent family life with nuance and a welcome ambiguity, freeing audience members to relate in a way that is best suited to their own experiences. I Saw the TV Glow forces us to consider whether the memories of our youth betrayed us, or if something more sinister is at play.—AM

Benjamin Ree (The Painter and the Thief, 2020) returns to the Festival with a heartwarming and adventurous journey through the breadth of Mats Steen’s digital life and his profound impact on a community. Thoughtfully beginning with an overview of Mats’ life from the Steens’ perspective, Ree then uncovers and revives Mats’ vibrant cyberself. Narrated entries from Mats’ published blog introduce us to Ibelin, his charismatic World of Warcraft persona. Mats’ personality is revealed in a fuller dimension through reconstructed animated moments from his gameplay and interviews with people who knew him as Ibelin. Mats’ parents’ deepest remorse was the thought of their son never experiencing love and friendships, but Ree offers an endearing and innovative portrait of Mats’ abundant life through World of Warcraft, underscoring how community and soulful relationships can transcend the boundaries of the physical world.—SO

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569ffb8fac9f442c0c03cc7,IGUALADA,World Cinema Documentary Competition,"In one of Latin America’s most unequal countries, Francia Márquez, a Black Colombian rural activist, challenges the status quo with a presidential campaign that reappropriates the derogatory term “Igualada” — someone who acts as if they deserve rights that supposedly don’t correspond to them — and inspires a nation to dream.
Director Juan Mejía Botero’s exclusive access to Francia Márquez’s presidential campaign reveals an unwavering commitment to fight inequality. Márquez’s presidential aspirations grew from the roots of dedicated social and environmental advocacy in her rural community of La Toma. Botero integrates into Márquez’s trusted circle, closely observing her and the campaign team’s tireless grassroots efforts to push her candidacy forward, while archival footage of a younger Márquez in La Toma reminds us of her long-standing activism. Márquez’s resonant slogan, “I am because we are,” rings through gatherings, galvanizing the rural and Afro-Colombian communities Márquez is fighting for, and echoing through the growing number of younger Colombians inspired by her message. They look to Márquez, faces filled with hope for a future where they might finally be represented. Botero captures the thrill and magnitude of this historic campaign from an inspiringly intimate vantage point, guided by Márquez’s mission and the collective strength and aspiration of the people.—SO

In his directorial feature debut, Chris Nash skillfully flips the slasher genre on its head by shifting the perspective from the victims to the killer with haunting effect. In A Violent Nature upends a formulaic mainstay featured within horror films for decades, minimizing familiar tropes to inject new life into the genre. Instead of dwelling alongside promiscuous young people in a remote forest cabin before they get what’s coming to them, the film keeps their unsuspecting voices in the distance as we follow a maniacal murderer trudging through the woods to stalk his prey. Infusing inventive kills with generous amounts of gore, Nash is methodical in his approach, setting an ominous and ambient tone that will linger within your psyche for a long time to come.—AM

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a0291fac9f45f6fc0425b,In the Land of Brothers,World Cinema Dramatic Competition,"Three members of an extended Afghan family start their lives over in Iran as refugees, unaware they face a decades-long struggle ahead to be “at home.”
Nearly 5 million Afghan refugees live in Iran, often with such tenuous legal status that any unexpected event could lead to forced deportation, family separation, or worse. Starting in 2001, these three stories elegantly and movingly capture the plight of people living their lives with hope and joy, but trapped under a state that constantly threatens police brutality, administrative violence, and armed conflict. In their feature debut, co-writers and directors Raha Amirfazli and Alireza Ghasemi dazzle as a new voice in Iranian cinema. But the lasting power of In the Land of Brothers lies in the indelible performances of its actors, whose humanity lends a specific perspective on the struggle of living as a refugee in Iran — but that will be recognizable around the world.—SS

With grounded thoughtfulness, debut feature director Alessandra Lacorazza weaves a rich tapestry of memories in New Mexico as childhood and adolescence collide with the realities of adulthood. René Pérez Joglar (also known by his musical moniker Residente) gives a layered and gut-wrenching performance as the charming-yet-troubled Vicente, struggling to fully connect with his daughters through games that slowly lose their luster in the shadow of his habits. A talented cast, including Sasha Calle and Lío Mehiel (Sundance Special Jury Prize for Performance as the lead of last year’s Mutt), inhabit Violeta and Eva through cinematic ellipses as their understanding of their father deepens. In The Summers proves both an emotional capsule of growing up within a fragmented family and a love letter to the resilience needed to survive.—AS

Writer-director Greg Jardin’s playful, sexy, and science fiction–infused feature debut plays out within a twisted parlor game among a flock of raffish social media obsessives. Within the soapy fun of the spirited party atmosphere, Jardin ratchets up the tension and thrills, cunningly deploying stylish expository clues so that audiences can marvel at the fast-paced plot twists without being left behind. Featuring Alycia Debnam-Carey, Brittany O’Grady, and James Morosini, the dynamic, up-and-coming ensemble cast play multiple variations of their romantically entangled, secret-keeping characters with a winking wit and humor. The production’s splashy, colorful visual style echoes the exuberance of the high-concept premise, allowing for a layered delight in this immensely entertaining, wholly original brainteaser of a film.—HZ

Director and co-writer Bruno Mourral’s explosive debut feature is a darkly funny but deadly serious political thriller set in one of the kidnapping capitals of the world. Kidnapping Inc. follows desperate criminals Doc (Jasmuel Andri) and Zoe (Rolaphton Mercure) on an irreverent, high-speed misadventure through the mean streets of Port-au-Prince, finding danger and intrigue at every hairpin turn. The film’s outrageous slapstick violence and furious pace are fueled by a deeper outrage at the widespread corruption, class inequality, and insecurity in Haitian society. Unlike his bumbling protagonists, Mourral takes no prisoners, populating this vivid, vulgar landscape with a motley assortment of crooked cops, scheming politicians, and freelance assassins. Anchored by Andri and Mercure, who bring warmth and charisma to their roles as would-be mercenaries, Kidnapping Inc. is also an affectionate buddy comedy that finds moments of grace and humanity amid the flying bullets.—MC

Three of them became a rap group called Kneecap. This anarchic Belfast trio becomes the unlikely figurehead of a civil rights movement to save the mother tongue.
Bursting forth from an often unpredictable and raucous post-Troubles Belfast, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, Naoise Ó Cairealláin, and JJ Ó Dochartaigh leap onto the screen to play themselves in this heightened and wildly entertaining tale of Kneecap’s origins, with Michael Fassbender in tow as the charismatic father figure turned political martyr. Armed with a blend of English and native Irish verses and blazing, politically charged rhymes, Kneecap’s music takes us on a ketamine-fueled, rollicking trip to encounter the meaning of pure defiance. Filmmaker Rich Peppiatt captures the untamable essence of this singular trio with unapologetic humor and energy, revealing a generation born out of chaos and ready to reclaim their cultural heritage. Fervent and unforgettable, Kneecap is the rallying cry of a music group poised to take the world by storm.—AS

In their hotly anticipated English-language debut, Dutch directing duo Steffen Haars and Flip van der Kuil (New Kids) spare no one, unleashing a deliriously fucked-up ode to the sanctity of family that consistently outdoes itself. Taking a studio audience–approved world and nuking it from the inside, Haars and van der Kuil bless us with their demented sense of humor and depravity. Nick Frost embodies Bernie Christian with zest, doing justice to his last name as a meek, devout head of household who’s suddenly forced into a bloodcurdling, jaw-dropping crusade when his spiritual foundations fail; Alicia Silverstone matches his madness as his gleefully mischievous wife. Miraculous in its very existence and gloriously unhinged, Krazy House begs to be seen to be believed.—AS

Amrou Al-Kadhi’s propulsive direction shines alongside Bilal Hasna’s breakout performance, and while Layla, the character, may be going through some qualms about identity, the film itself is a proud queer love story — with all the complications involved. Under Al-Kadhi’s care, the audience is ushered into the sanctity of queer spaces, the nightclub and the beauty supply store, places for more than just entertainment, doors to a more embodied, honest existence, a home, an Eden of sorts. Al-Kadhi is unafraid to question who isn’t welcome in these spaces and the isolation one faces when certain demarcation becomes too clear to ignore. Layla is a tale of self-acceptance and community love, so come for some fun and boogie to all the club hits! There’s plenty of sparkle to go around.—AE

Acclaimed music video director Jack Begert’s idiosyncratic debut feature, co-written with Dani Goffstein, takes a cockeyed but sensitive look at Hollywood dreams and disappointments. Little Death is a dark comedy about a screenwriter’s (David Schwimmer) midlife identity crisis and a crime drama about a pair of taco truck entrepreneurs (Talia Ryder and Dominic Fike) in search of their next opioid fix. In true Los Angeles fashion, these characters collide at a tragicomic intersection, and the film shifts gears from barbed showbiz satire to an introspective hangout vibe. Throughout, Little Death stays deeply attuned to the inner lives of its restless dreamers, examining their efforts to find meaning and connection while struggling against the fickleness of fate and the illusion of free will. Begert deploys disorienting bursts of surreal montage and oddball AI animation to convey Schwimmer’s fractured psyche and draws on a terrific ensemble including Jena Malone, Gaby Hoffman, and Karl Glusman.—MC

What started as a farewell tour for the band Jane’s Addiction rose from the underground to launch a cultural movement and change music forever.
Michael John Warren, veteran filmmaker behind acclaimed story-driven documentaries and innovative concert films, brings a deft understanding of music and culture to his Sundance Film Festival debut, Lolla: The Story of Lollapalooza. The untethered energy of 1990s American youth counterculture finds focus in roiling mosh pits, raging to artists like Jane’s Addiction, Nine Inch Nails, Pearl Jam, and Sonic Youth, and gaining exposure to social activism, political art, and alternative circuses. A wealth of archival footage from audience and band perspectives leads to an immersive experience akin to the festival itself, touching on behind-the-scenes machinations as much as the impact of music previously out of reach to its listeners.—DC

Look Into My Eyes by Lana Wilson (Miss Americana, Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields, The Departure) gives us an intimate view of psychics in New York City. Over a series of interviews and with a camera that is not afraid to get up close and personal, Wilson highlights the ins and outs of being a psychic and what that entails, while constructing a tender portrayal of the clients. A thoughtfully paced and oftentimes deeply personal piece, it unfolds the grief, turmoil, and loneliness that come along with being a human. On the flip side, the joys of gaining clarity, achieving closure, and even having a pet are experienced.

But their love ignites violence, pulling them deep into the web of Lou’s criminal family.
Following her critically acclaimed first feature Saint Maud, Rose Glass makes her Sundance Film Festival debut with a bombastic, larger-than-life sophomore effort. An off-the-wall, rambunctious lesbian love story crashes into a family drama of the darkest ilk in this muscular thriller. As a small-town gym and a ravine just outside city limits become the playground for all flavors of mischief and mayhem, a heightened Americana sensibility and Glass’ deliciously distinctive, bold style create a world that is at once familiar and entirely fresh. Helmed by Sundance regular Kristen Stewart (Speak, Adventureland, Certain Women) and Katy O’Brian, Love Lies Bleeding is somehow as sweetly romantic about loyalty as it is doggedly hedonistic. With a vaulting imagination and its roots in deeply human places, this film packs a gut punch unlike any other.—AH

As filmmakers Sam & Andy demonstrate in their wildly imaginative debut feature, telling the love story of a smart buoy and an orbiting satellite that spans a billion years and probes the mysteries of being and consciousness requires legit storytelling dexterity. Love Me’s whimsically philosophical, shape-shifting structure ingeniously weaves together the real, the virtual, and the surreal. Its star-crossed, web-paired metallic protagonists — inhabited in different forms by Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun — awkwardly navigate romance and companionship, equipped only with untold petabytes of archived web data, social media, and online videos. Awash in these mediated experiences and fabricated expressions of love and identity, they yearn to understand who they are, whether their feelings are real, and for that matter, whether they are real.—JN

His undeniable talent earned platinum records and accolades, but he struggled to break out beyond the R&B charts. Intensely driven, he overcame personal and professional challenges to secure his place amongst the greatest vocalists in history. 
If you know, you know — there’s only one Luther. Acclaimed Festival alum Dawn Porter invites audiences on a musical journey into the life of the iconic Luther Vandross, the man with the soulful velvet voice. An archival tapestry of performances and recording sessions immerse us in his legendary musical talent as a singer, songwriter, and producer. Porter then goes beyond the spotlight to delve into the man behind the music — insights from musicians and friends alongside archival interviews with Luther himself reveal his humor, frustrations, loneliness, and unwavering dedication to his craft. 
Luther: Never Too Much delivers a sensitive and jubilant celebration of Luther Vandross and his music that resonates with evocative power. Some will form newfound admiration for Luther, while others will be transported to moments when his timeless melodies were the soundtrack to their lives. Good luck not singing along and dancing in your seat.—SO

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a02c7fac9f47e77c042de,Malu,World Cinema Dramatic Competition,"Malu — a mercurial, unemployed actress living with her conservative mother in a precarious house in a Rio de Janeiro slum — tries to deal with her strained relationship with her own adult daughter while surviving on memories of her glorious artistic past.
Director Pedro Freire artfully depicts the tumultuous, at times toxic, relationship between three generations of outspoken women in his energetic feature debut, Malu. Freire’s script carefully delineates how the ripples of generational trauma have permanently poisoned the family’s ties, but a tattered, instinctual affection lingers beneath the resentments, as the women alternatively hurt and protect, offend, and care for one another.At the center is the larger-than-life Malu — a woman compelled to reassert her connection to her faded stardom at any cost — embodied by Yara de Novaes in a performance that masterfully balances volatility, magnetism, and vulnerability. Actors Carol Duarte and Juliana Carneiro da Cunha ably offer support and depth as Malu’s frustrated daughter and feisty, embittered mother, respectively, as the fluctuating chemistry of their fraught familial dynamic further illuminates this fascinating, imperfect woman.—HZ

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6573b5fd8c1a1ff3bf01b2f7,Mississippi Masala,40th Edition Celebration Screenings and Events,"Shot on location in Kampala, Uganda, and Mississippi, Mira Nair’s second feature film tells the story of an upper-class Indian family forced to flee Idi Amin’s tyranny in 1972. After nearly two decades of travel and expatriate existence, they find themselves in Greenwood, Mississippi, where they join relatives in running a motel. Their daughter, Mina, is basically “Westernized” and also capable of achieving more than the day-to-day jobs at the motel. When she meets Demetrius, an enterprising young carpet cleaner, their relationship creates an uproar amongst their respective family and friends. The closet racism that has remained hidden behind a veneer of unity rears its ugly head, resulting in dire consequences.
With an interracial relationship at its center and Indian American filmmaker at its helm, Mississippi Masala explored the intersecting issues of racism, colorism, and displacement with extraordinary nuance at a time when these types of stories were scarce. The film screened in the 1992 Sundance Film Festival at the Opening Night in Park City. Mississippi Masala’s 4K digital restoration, which will screen at the upcoming Festival, was undertaken by Janus Film and the Criterion Collection and supervised by Nair and cinematographer Ed Lachman.
""Welcome to Black and brown skins in the same frame, to my 30-year-old but still radical film, Mississippi Masala! We gathered movie stars from all across the world to tell this tale of Idi Amin's expulsion of Asians from Uganda in 1972 and their prickly embrace into the Mississippi Delta. This was a movie that went missing, until I tracked the only print available to a music store in Nashville, Tennessee. The owner turned out to be a major fan and sold me back the rights of the film for one dollar,” said Nair. “What you're about to see is a beautiful 4K restoration undertaken by Criterion and supervised by legendary cinematographer Ed Lachman and myself.”

The encounter spurs a funny and heartfelt journey of self-discovery and first love as Elliott prepares to leave her childhood home.
Writer-director Megan Park’s tender, surprising sophomore feature cleverly uses its high-concept premise of a visit from one’s future self to launch a refreshing, nuanced exploration of the uncertainties of young romance and coming of age. My Old Ass is a sweet teenage love story, a lively contemporary comedy, and a quirky riff on time-travel films all in one. 
Maisy Stella and Aubrey Plaza have a terrific unlikely chemistry, as the sass and self-assuredness of the young Elliott, as played by Stella, blends and overlaps with Plaza’s sardonic humor as a more mature Elliott. The care and affection shown in the film’s depiction of Elliott’s rural hometown in her last days before taking off for adulthood visually highlights her emotional journey, evoking a nostalgia for days that haven’t even ended yet.—HZ","Premieres, All Features, Women-Centered Stories, Comedy, Drama, Fiction, Romance, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6573b5148c1a1f1de001b209,Napoleon Dynamite,40th Edition Celebration Screenings and Events,"Napoleon is an outcast high school student in Idaho who spends his days drawing mythical beasts, duking it out with his fragile brother Kip, and avoiding his Uncle Rico, who is stuck in his “glory” days of high school football. When friends Deb and Pedro come into his life, the trio launch a campaign to elect Pedro for class president. Together, they must rely on their knowledge of cows, piñatas, and Napoleon’s surprise special talent in order to defeat the stuck-up frontrunner, Summer Wheatley. Sporting some sweet moon boots and relying on his illegal government ninja moves, Napoleon Dynamite seeks to become a new kind of hero.
In a modest film made with a ton of heart, Jon Heder gives a truly awe-inspiring performance as the titular character, while writer-director Jared Hess and his co-writer wife, Jerusha Hess, flesh out this world and its characters so brilliantly that it takes multiple viewings to truly savor the magnificence that is Napoleon Dynamite. Like all great comedies, the genius is in the details. 
Since its premiere at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival in the U.S. Dramatic Competition almost 20 years ago, Napoleon Dynamite’s quirky humor and offbeat characters have sustained a lasting impact on pop culture, proliferating endless references in popular media and a steadfast following. The film’s brand-new restoration will debut at the upcoming Festival. The original 35mm cut negative was digitally scanned at a 4K resolution by Disney and Searchlight Pictures. All color and restoration work was also performed at 4K resolution, which was approved by the director, Jared Hess.
“Returning to Sundance with Napoleon Dynamite feels like a homecoming. When it premiered at the festival 20 years ago, we never anticipated the incredible reaction it would receive,” said Hess. “It’s always been a very personal film for Jerusha and me, so the love affair it’s had with audiences all these years continues to delight us. To commemorate its 20th anniversary, we are thrilled to screen this newly restored version of Napoleon Dynamite. The restoration team did an amazing job bringing to life new details from the original film’s negative that we’d never seen before. We can’t wait to share it!” 
Park City screening will be followed by a conversation with screenwriter Jerusha Hess, actor Jon Heder, and more.

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569ffd3fac9f461efc03d38,Never Look Away,World Cinema Documentary Competition,"New Zealand–born groundbreaking CNN camerawoman Margaret Moth risks it all to show the reality of war from inside the conflict, staring down danger and confronting those who perpetuate it.
Moth’s intrepid energy and kinetic lust are rendered beautifully in this documentary, which deftly captures both her powerful personality and the nascent development of the 24-hour news cycle. Never Look Away asks hard-hitting questions about where our desire for conflict coverage comes from, whether it can ever be satiated, and what we are running from when we are absorbed by work and by relentless global news. Moth's indelible commitment to her work, her striking aesthetic, her deeply mysterious nature, and her gargantuan contributions to the field of journalism all come to the fore in this potent biopic.
Renowned actor Lucy Lawless (Xena: Warrior Princess, Battlestar Galactica, Parks and Recreation) steps behind the camera in this impressive directorial debut. Lawless creates a distinctively female, Kiwi lens to cover this titanic career, showing both the horrors and life-affirming dimensions of war from a woman’s point of view.—AH

Deep in the pitch-black forest, a few hundred moths are drawn by a single source of illumination to a piece of hung canvas. Only through this intimate examination can their existence, and the happenings of their world, be made visible. Though moth life spans are measured in hours and represent only a small amount of the immense biodiversity of their species, in these small beings lies a history of our planet. With a transportive and experiential visual style and immersive sound that brings you to a place few people can travel, co-directors Anirban Dutta and Anupama Srinivasan’s Nocturnes gives us a multimillennia vision of time nearly beyond our human-scale perception.—SS

With the help of some assistive technology and her devoted, exuberant allies, Melody shows that what she has to say is more important than how she says it.
Out of My Mind presents a sincere experience of teenage girlhood through the lenses of disability and belonging. Director Amber Sealey crafts a world around Melody that is all too familiar; at once full of love, fun, and opportunity, yet systemically unfair to those who are different. Actor Phoebe-Rae Taylor, who similarly lives with cerebral palsy, embodies Melody from a place of authenticity and heart. 
Melody’s wants courageously steer this narrative — her desires to prove her intelligence, befriend girls her age, and, ultimately, break free from the limiting preconceptions of others, are both unique and deeply universal. This is a powerful story about finding one’s voice, bolstered by the collective passion and advocacy of those who are willing to really listen.—CA","Family Matinee, All Features, Science & Technology, Women-Centered Stories, Fiction, Suitable For All Ages, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

Pariah first premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival as a short film. It later returned to the 2011 Festival as a feature film premiering in the U.S. Dramatic Competition, where it received an Excellence in Cinematography Award. Director Dee Rees workshopped Pariah in the Sundance Institute’s Directors and Screenwriters Labs and received three separate Institute grants to support production of the film. After opening to critical acclaim, Pariah, a young Black lesbian’s coming-of-age story, quickly became part of the LGBTQ+ film canon.
“I’m moved and excited to be coming back to where it all began and celebrating this special anniversary with the Institute,” said Pariah director Dee Rees. “From the lab advisors, to the fellows, to the audiences, Sundance was that magically supportive and generous community that enabled Pariah to be born in the world and it's always a joyous, heady feeling to return.”

Ponyboi bursts off the screen in this bombastic, edgy, and campy roller-coaster ride of a film. Flipping the script on the LGBTQIA+ return home tale and the classic Jersey mobster saga, this neon-soaked story is not only full of action but also pure moments of tenderness. Complicated and hilarious, Ponyboi’s journey exposes a kaleidoscope of ways humanity is sugary sweet under hard surfaces. Backdrops of laundromats, diners, and the Jersey Shore create a heightened sense of place and time that is at once precisely transportative and fantastically imaginary. 
Director Esteban Arango returns to the Sundance Film Festival after his feature film debut in 2020 with Blast Beat. His signature liveliness, energy, and Latinx lens are present and blossoming in this sophomore effort. Writer, producer, and lead actor River Gallo delivers a thrilling performance and a ripe emotional foundation that absolutely sings.

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a07e2fac9f43bafc04673,Porcelain War,U.S. Documentary Competition,"Under roaring fighter jets and missile strikes, Ukrainian artists Slava, Anya, and Andrey choose to stay behind and fight, contending with the soldiers they have become. Defiantly finding beauty amid destruction, they show that although it’s easy to make people afraid, it’s hard to destroy their passion for living.
And how does one continue to live when everything you love is under a vicious attack? Porcelain War argues that you can learn to fight back using all the tools you have, including your art, in order to avoid erasure. “We’re ordinary people in an extraordinary situation” is how co-director Slava Leontyev describes their current life. Meanwhile, there is absolutely nothing ordinary about them — these artists, farmers, IT specialists — coming together to fight their oppressor. Porcelain War is a true cinematic gem. Leontyev and co-director Brendan Bellomo manage to gracefully capture the dissonance between the horrors of war and the fragile beauty of nature and artistic practice. Anya’s and Slava’s porcelain pieces come to life in delicately crafted animations that offer context to their makers’ story and a stunning outlet for processing grief.—AT

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a0c00fac9f489e3c04a68,Power,Premieres,"Driven to maintain social order, policing in the United States has exploded in scope and scale over hundreds of years. Now, American policing embodies one word: power.
A cogent essay film inviting conscious engagement and reflection on a system of control that has gone largely unquestioned, Power is a sweeping chronicle of the history and evolution of policing in the U.S. With assured precision and deep insight, filmmaker Yance Ford (Strong Island, U.S. Documentary Special Jury Award for Storytelling, 2017 Sundance Film Festival) compellingly argues that the perceived danger of race to the status quo is central to the origins of policing and to its unchecked expansion. Asking pointed, uncomfortable questions about privilege and class; about who belongs to the social order and who is excluded; and about our collective responsibility in actively or tacitly permitting those in power to escape accountability, Power confronts us with the prescient words of Frederick Douglass: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”—BT

Following groundbreaking work like sex, lies, and videotape (1989 Sundance Film Festival, Audience Award: Dramatic) and The Girlfriend Experience (2009 Sundance Film Festival), he returns to Park City with a film shot entirely in one location that will haunt audiences with its otherworldly story and constantly awe-inspiring visuals.

Filmmaker Scott Cummings is no stranger to Sundance, having edited many highly acclaimed festival premieres over the past decade, including Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Monsters and Men, and Wendy. 
REALM OF SATAN marks his feature-length directorial debut after first staking his claim in the peripheries of nonfiction-adjacent storytelling with his acclaimed short film Buffalo Juggalos. His unique approach is to work in collaboration with sinister subcultures to conjure up video portraits that express a vision of their personal existence. As Cummings works in lockstep with cinematographer Gerald Kerkletz, each shot is its own small treasure to explore, whether fantastical, explicit, mundane, or all of the above. REALM OF SATAN’s acceptance in an unreality sets itself on an anarchistic path through expressions of identity and image-making that nobly fights all forms of tradition.—CS

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a02d4fac9f4f26dc04324,Reinas,World Cinema Dramatic Competition,"Surrounded by social and political chaos in Lima during the summer of 1992, Lucia, Aurora, and their mother, Elena, plan to leave and seek opportunities in the United States. Their farewell involves reconnecting with their estranged father, Carlos, adding turbulence to the regrets, hopes, and fears of their emotional departure.
Director Klaudia Reynicke subtly weaves a tale of shifts and sacrifices that shows, whatever the familial configuration, strength and loss are necessary parts of growth. Grounded by a strong performance from Jimena Lindo as Elena and a wonderfully inquisitive Abril Gjurinovic, a family is brought to life. Reynicke’s effective direction honors each community the camera focuses on, and her Lima, the city where Reynicke grew up, feels personal, like a memory or a version of a city that no longer exists  but emerges vibrant and alive in the film. Reinas is truly an emotional trip, transporting the viewer to Lima in the ’90s, right into the heart of a family faced with a universal challenge: the search for a safer place.—AE

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fa4dfac9f4390cc032ef,Rob Peace,Premieres,"Robert Peace grew up in an impoverished section of Newark and later graduated from Yale with degrees in molecular biophysics and biochemistry while on scholarship. Peace led a dual life in academia and research while also earning six figures selling marijuana. Based on Jeff Hobbs’ bestselling biography.
Chiwetel Ejiofor’s thoughtful adaptation of Hobbs’ biography examines Peace’s struggle to reconcile his academic ambitions with mounting economic and family pressures. Although Peace’s (Jay Will) talents are nurtured from childhood by his devoted mother (Mary J. Blige), he lives in the shadow of his father (Ejiofor) who is imprisoned for a murky double murder. Intellectually curious and restlessly entrepreneurial, Peace lives a divided life, tenaciously working in a university research lab while secretly raising cash for his dad’s defense. Detailing Peace’s dual rise within the ranks of Yale and the Newark drug trade, Rob Peace explores the double bind between being true to one’s dreams and faithful to one’s roots, exposing the contradictions in the American dream for young Black men. Will vividly conveys Peace’s inner turmoil while Ejiofor gives an anguished performance as his mercurial father.—MC

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fbb7fac9f43cb4c0367b,Sasquatch Sunset,Premieres,"A year in the life of a singular family.
Sasquatch Sunset is, indeed, an utterly singular filmmaking feat. Deploying a daring approach with ferocious commitment, David and Nathan Zellner’s imaginative work captures quotidian sasquatch life with detail and rigor that is simply unforgettable. The Zellner brothers continue their long-standing contributions to the Sundance catalog with this zany gem, after collaborating on memorable Festival standouts like Damsel (2018), Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter (2014), KID-THING (2012), and even the felicitously titled short Sasquatch Birth Journal 2 (2011). 
In a time where likenesses are of the utmost preciousness to actors, the dynamic duo Jesse Eisenberg and Riley Keough eschew traditional appearances and ego in a fantastic display of raw performance chops, dazzling dedication, and rare boldness. Eisenberg returns to Sundance after many performances (first in 2009 with Adventureland) and most recently his 2022 directorial debut, When You Finish Saving The World, as does Keough (starting in 2016’s The Girlfriend Experience and most recently with Zola in 2020), but this time in stunning, definitively never-seen-before fashion.—AH","Premieres, All Features, Environmental Issues, Action/Adventure, Fiction, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a02e1fac9f433ecc0436d,Sebastian,World Cinema Dramatic Competition,"Max, a 25-year-old aspiring writer living in London, begins a double life as a sex worker in order to research his debut novel.
In his assured sophomore feature, Finnish-British writer-director Mikko Mäkelä explores the transgressive power of queer sexuality and the transformative impact that can result from embracing a new identity. Far from simply informing his secretly autobiographical fiction writing, Max’s experiences as “Sebastian” awaken a deeper sense of self, unshackled from societal expectations. Ruaridh Mollica impresses in the lead role, embodying Max with an initially hesitant curiosity that blossoms into exhilaration and ease as he becomes subsumed within his nocturnal alias. Eschewing the sensationalism or moralizing that often accompanies stories of sex work, Sebastian instead offers a refreshing, sex-positive take in a film that ultimately celebrates the liberation that accompanies self-exploration.—BT
This film contains graphic sexual content. Audiences must be 18 or older.

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a0903fac9f43782c04901,Seeking Mavis Beacon,NEXT,"Launched in the late ’80s, educational software Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing taught millions globally, but the program’s Haitian-born cover model vanished decades ago. Two DIY investigators search for the unsung cultural icon, while questioning notions of digital security, AI, and Black representation in the digital realm.
Jazmin Renée Jones’ inventive directorial debut boldly embraces outspoken questioning. Jones turns the camera onto herself and co-investigator Olivia McKayla Ross, foregrounding their investigatory process and supportive friendship. While unraveling the complex narrative of Mavis Beacon, they uplift the pioneering of Black women in technology and self-reflect on their own methodologies in the process. Jones celebrates diverse ways of embodying knowledge by creatively connecting various sources of information. Observational footage of herself and Ross sit alongside interviews, memes, and insights from activists and artists. The meaning of each clip is made richer by Jones’ astute and witty layering, often incorporating the digital interface of a desktop. The dynamic investigation also reveals questions about documentary practice, the incompleteness of archives, and the right to exist on one’s own terms. Jones’ vision is vibrant, full of curiosity, and refreshingly openhearted. —SO

This immersive, vertiginous nail-biter takes audiences nearly 2,230 feet up in the sky. But to get there, filmmaker Jeff Zimbalist crafts a real-life heist film with actual life-or-death stakes, following its daredevil protagonists every dangerous — and highly illegal — step of the way of their mission. From carefully staking out their target and selecting an ingenious time to make their attempt, to evading security and risking their freedom — not to mention their lives — the Russian rooftoppers bring the viewer along for a wild and breathtaking ride. Just as importantly, the film captures a strong-willed couple as they meet, develop trust in the most harrowing and exhilarating of circumstances, and fall in love in the process. Skywalkers: A Love Story is a riveting, edge-of-your-seat experience about facing your fears and coming out the other side.—BT

Director Johan Grimonprez (Double Take, 2009) returns to Sundance with this magnificent essay film that vibrantly embodies the historic and continually evolving colonial machinations that underpin what author and Congolese writer In Koli Jean Bofane refers to as an ever-evolving “algorithm of Congo Inc.”
In addition to Bofane’s observations, Grimonprez invokes a veritable canon of African American jazz music to animate a rich fabric of griot texts, eyewitness accounts, official government memos, and testimonies from mercenaries and CIA operatives to shine light on one of the most insidious political machinations of the 20th century: how the Belgian monarchy, the United States government, and multinational corporations colluded to weaponize art institutions and legendary jazz musicians as cover for covert operations to assassinate Congo’s premiere prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. 
Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat is a timely story of precedent that speaks to today’s geopolitical terrain, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and around the world.—SF

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a0147fac9f4878ec040b0,Stress Positions,U.S. Dramatic Competition,"Terry Goon is keeping strict quarantine in his ex-husband’s Brooklyn brownstone while caring for his nephew — a 19-year-old model from Morocco named Bahlul — bedridden in a full leg cast after an electric scooter accident. Unfortunately for Terry, everyone in his life wants to meet the model.
Stress Positions is as much a finely tuned time capsule of the frantic fear and formative power of the pandemic as it is a road map out of dark places guided by a profound humanity. A careful balance between a consistent, razor-sharp humor and the development of a distinctive cinematic tone creates a particular mood and energy that is not easily forgotten.
Returning to the Sundance Film Festival after her 2021 appearance as writer-director and star of the Episodic My Trip to Spain, Theda Hammel once again proves herself to be a prolific powerhouse with her directorial debut. Hammel’s clever script, energetic performance, confident directorial style, and beautifully crafted score come together in an exciting whirl of charisma and social commentary. John Early (at Sundance with My Trip to Spain in 2021 and Save Yourselves! in 2020) delivers a hilariously tense performance among a talented young cast. Stress Positions at once ratchets up raw nerves and also helps us release them.—AH

Alongside her fiancée, U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe, Sue confronts her next challenge: retiring from the only life she’s ever known.
A trailblazer in every sense of the word, Sue Bird achieved a powerful impact on the game of basketball. Navigating through adversity in the form of sexism, anti-LGBTQ+ prejudice, and racism toward many of her peers, she managed to forge a path for young women that previously didn’t exist. The lack of resources for women’s sports in the U.S. led Bird to spend her offseasons playing in Russia, where, ironically, she received the recognition and equity that her male counterparts enjoyed back at home. Emmy and Peabody Award–winning documentarian Sarah Dowland gets to the heart of what makes Bird one of the greatest and most influential athletes the world has ever seen, both on and off the court.—AM

Filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie deliver a multilayered film that invites audiences to confront profound questions about morality and justice, and to bear witness to the lasting intergenerational legacy of trauma from the residential school system —  including forced family separation, physical and sexual abuse, and the destruction of Native culture and language. Drawing on their backgrounds in activism and journalism — as well as NoiseCat's own personal connection to the story and community — the filmmakers deftly weave together multiple strands to form this compelling, heartbreaking narrative. Demonstrating unparalleled humanity, compassion, and grace for the affected Indigenous communities in North America, their powerful documentary operates from a place of pure and total empathy. At the same time, NoiseCat and Kassie recognize the resilience of the survivors and their descendants, and their unflagging determination to seek answers to long-buried secrets. Ultimately, Sugarcane reminds us to respect the humanity in ourselves as well as in others.—BB

The shadow of violence surrounds Sujo during each stage of his life in the isolated Mexican countryside. As he grows into a man, Sujo finds that fulfilling his father’s destiny may be inescapable.
A breathtaking film and the second collaboration of filmmakers Astrid Rondero and Fernanda Valadez (Identifying Features), Sujo recenters stories of cartel violence by exploring its aftermath, the collateral damage, and its orphans. With lyrical intensity and a penetrating humanity, it offers a moving, contemporary coming-of-age portrait of Sujo, a young man named after a strong-willed horse, and the way his identity, consciousness, and moral character are shaped through various episodes — by the women who protect him, the boys lured toward their fathers’ fates, the mentorship of a teacher — as if they are seasons in his growth. A rich tapestry of motifs reflects on how cycles are formed and broken. As a gunman’s son, is Sujo’s fate governed by circumstance or by something innate, akin to his spirited namesake?—JN

Inspired by a semi-autobiographical story.
Writer-director Laura Chinn makes an unforgettable debut with a script inspired by her own teenage experience. Set in 2005 in St. Petersburg, Florida, Suncoast is a sensitively told coming-of-age story as Chinn’s young heroine finds friendship through unexpected connections and gestures and is forced to reckon with the gravity of her brother’s health. In a breakout role, Nico Parker embodies Doris, an awkward high schooler whose unique and troubling home life ultimately provides opportunities for her freedom and an unexpected entrée into the popular kids’ clique. Laura Linney shines as Doris’ preoccupied mother and finds complex human behavior under unimaginable circumstances. Separately and together, a mother and daughter face a situation bigger than themselves that builds to a crescendo of deep emotional power and pathos.—KY

He learned the true meaning of heroism as an activist after suffering a tragic accident that left him quadriplegic and dependent on a ventilator to breathe.
Moving backward and forward in time, filmmakers Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui expertly weave together a dual narrative exploring the life-changing impact of two pivotal moments in Christopher Reeve's career: being cast in 1978's Superman and becoming paralyzed in 1995. Decades before superheroes took over the cinemas, Reeve made the world believe a man could fly; his accident brought worldwide awareness of disability. In Super/Man, Reeve's family and close confidantes demonstrate remarkable candor in their reflections on life before and after the accident. The result is a deeply moving film foregrounding the man behind Superman — not a hagiography, but a full-fledged portrait that encompasses both the soaring heights and the dark depths of Reeve's journey.—BT","Premieres, All Features, Biography, Nonfiction, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fe9efac9f44127c03b27,Tendaberry,NEXT,"When her boyfriend goes back to Ukraine to be with his ailing father, 23-year-old Dakota anxiously navigates her precarious new reality, surviving on her own in New York City.
Writer-director Haley Elizabeth Anderson’s moving debut feature is an intimately scaled character study and an openhearted love letter to Brooklyn. Tendaberry’s elliptical narrative unfurls in an intricate patchwork of lyrical handheld cinematography, found footage fragments, spectral home movies, and documentary digressions. Anderson devotes the film’s first movement to a tender and clear-eyed portrait of young love before shifting her attention to Dakota’s (Kota Johan) life after loss and her struggles to stay afloat and forge community with fellow migrants in a rapidly gentrifying landscape. Tendaberry sensitively charts Dakota’s inner journey while also looking outward to craft an elegiac portrait of the city she calls home. In a breakout performance, Johan brings Dakota’s delicate but defiant voice to the foreground, both through poetic narration and lovely musical performances. —MC

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569ff27fac9f446d2c03b90,The  Moogai,Midnight,"A young Aboriginal couple bring home their second baby. What should be a joyous time takes a sinister turn as the mother starts seeing a malevolent spirit she is convinced is trying to take her baby.
Adapted from his award-winning short and made with the producers of The Babadook and Talk to Me, Jon Bell’s debut feature draws from Indigenous lore for a thematically rich supernatural tale that quickly establishes the lurking menace of a child-stealing spirit. Its simmering suspense empathetically builds around the fragile psychology of a new mother, blurring the lines between exhaustion, paranoia, and postpartum depression. In exacerbating her isolation and hopelessness, Bell shrewdly accentuates traditional tools of oppression to reveal a darker allusion to Australia’s stolen generations — the tens of thousands of First Nations children forcibly removed from their families through the government’s assimilation policies — which the filmmaker calls a “massive wound in the psyche of Australia.” The Moogai bears its terrifying resonance out of sublimated trauma.—JN

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fd77fac9f43da0c039b1,The American Society of Magical Negroes,Premieres,"A young man, Aren, is recruited into a secret society of magical Black people who dedicate their lives to a cause of utmost importance: making white people’s lives easier.
If The Birth of a Nation by D.W. Griffith is proclaimed “the greatest picture ever made,” then the “Magical Negro” — a Black supporting character who exists solely to serve a white protagonist’s storyline — has been a stock character trope since the inception of American cinema.
Debut director Kobi Libii engages this trope in this clever and delightful fairytale-like romantic comedy about the coming of age of a young Black man who is propositioned to become a real-life Magical Negro upon narrowly escaping death after a string of racial microaggressions get out of hand.
The American Society of Magical Negroes is a must-see satire about what it means for Black people to protect and care for ourselves and each other. Libii’s auspicious debut is destined to find its place in the cinematic canon of essential films about American culture.—SF","Premieres, All Features, Fiction, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6573b5f88c1a1fe63001b2c6,The Babadook,40th Edition Celebration Screenings and Events,"“Do you want to die?!” 7-year-old Samuel asks his stressed-out single mother, Amelia. She wonders if his question is a threat or a warning. After dealing with Samuel’s frantic tantrums his entire life, Amelia suspects that her son has begun directing his violent misbehavior toward her. However, after a dark and foreboding children’s book called Mister Babadook mysteriously appears on Samuel’s bookshelf, Amelia must decide if her son is truly deranged, or if there really is a bogeyman lurking in their darkened halls at night.
First-time feature director Jennifer Kent vividly captured the vicious turbulence of Samuel’s shrill outbursts, generating a real sense of horror from his aggressive unruliness, all the while subtly hinting at the weary Amelia’s own deeply troubled nature. The Babadook builds up tension and dread in this damaged family’s home before deftly introducing the terrifying possibility that something even more ominous may be stalking the dysfunctional pair. 
The Babadook premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival in the Midnight section, where it was acquired by IFC Midnight. The film’s skillful exploration of motherhood and grief, coupled with its innovative approach to the psychological horror genre, earned The Babadook widespread critical acclaim and cemented a loyal following.  “I definitely have some distance on Babadook now, after 10 years. The film feels like an old friend, one that changed my life in many ways,” said Kent. “Sundance was such a huge part of that change. I look forward to ‘coming home’ to the place where it all began, and to the festival that has given me and ‘Mister B’ so much.”

Co-directors Daphne Matziaraki (4.1 Miles, The Me You Can’t See) and Pete Murimi (I Am Samuel) craft The Battle for Laikipia with empathy, compassion, and brutal truth. Weaving together themes of environmentalism, colonialism, and conservationism, the film delicately showcases the impact of these crucial topics on the Indigenous farming community of Kenya’s Laikipia region. Handled with care, Matziaraki and Murimi’s The Battle for Laikipia takes us through a journey that elicits frustration, awe, curiosity, and wonder.—BB

For filmmaker Asmae El Moudir, those lies began with the conspicuous absence of childhood photographs and her grandmother’s dubious explanations. As she discovers, the truth lies in Casablanca’s bread riots of 1981 and the government’s violent crackdown — long since concealed and banished from the collective memory. Lacking archival evidence, El Moudir and her father build a meticulously detailed model of their former neighborhood, incorporating handmade figurines. In enlisting the help of family, friends, and neighbors, she effectively creates an intervention, pushing them to confront the truth through its many perspectives, even that of her scornful grandmother, the authoritarian matriarch who embodies this willful amnesia. 
Premiering at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, El Moudir’s extraordinary project offers a unique, spellbinding approach to excavating a painful history.—JN

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fcf9fac9f46ec2c03908,The Outrun,Premieres,"After living life on the edge in London, Rona attempts to come to terms with her troubled past. She returns to the wild beauty of Scotland’s Orkney Islands — where she grew up — hoping to heal. Adapted from the bestselling memoir by Amy Liptrot.
Nora Fingscheidt’s poignant adaptation of Amy Liptrot’s fearless memoir details the author’s liberation from drug and alcohol addiction, a triumph forged on the enchanted, wind-battered coasts of her childhood home. The Outrun traces Rona’s false starts and setbacks on the road to recovery through harrowing flashbacks to her downward spiral in London and her reckoning with reality in a strict rehab program. But Fingscheidt is more concerned with Rona’s final destination — deliverance from personal demons through transcendent communion with nature. Grounded in local lore and rich with Liptrot’s journalistic digressions on the land and its life-forms, The Outrun artfully ties Rona’s healing to her growing environmental stewardship. Four-time Academy Award nominee Saoirse Ronan gives a heartbreaking, humane performance that moves from woozy self-annihilation to serene calm.—MC

Rory Kennedy, whose intuitive yet methodical nonfiction storytelling style demonstrated in Sundance Film Festival projects includes Ghosts of Abu Ghraib (2007), Last Days in Vietnam (2014), and Downfall: The Case Against Boeing (2022), returns with her signature commitment to first-person perspectives in The Synanon Fix. Former members recollect the hope and community the breakthrough treatment center and its dynamic founder initially provided, before the decadeslong transition to an organization centered on control and violence. Compellingly interspersed with newly found footage, this film presents authentic insights that transcend the presentation of an experiment gone horrifically awry, crafted as a cultural touchstone of charismatic leaders and vulnerable followers.—DC

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6573b6048c1a1ffe8a01b32a,The Times of Harvey Milk,40th Edition Celebration Screenings and Events,"Set in San Francisco in the 1970s, The Times of Harvey Milk tells of the extraordinary rise to power of a long-haired, gay camera store owner from the Castro District who became one of the city’s most colorful and influential elected officials, as well as one of the decade’s most prominent leaders of the LGBTQ+ rights movement — that is, until he was shot and killed at City Hall by former police officer and fellow supervisor  Dan White. Harvey Milk’s journey to that fateful day is recounted brilliantly through the course of the film. 
A riveting, volatile, dynamic, and impassioned documentary, The Times of Harvey Milk’s stranger-than-fiction story is immensely moving, combining real emotional urgency with a compelling grasp of filmmaking craft. A moving affirmation and revelation of how one man can make a difference, it is a quintessential work about American values in conflict, which highlights a courageous and charismatic individual while exposing an incredible miscarriage of justice. As political renegades go, Milk wasn’t afforded the time to become a household name.
By memorializing the remarkable life and political career of LGBTQ+ advocate Milk, The Times of Harvey Milk played a pivotal role in influencing public opinion and discourse on gay rights. The documentary received widespread acclaim, indicated by its 1985 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. It also received the Special Jury Prize (Documentary) at Sundance's very first festival in 1985, where it screened in the U.S. Documentary Competition. The film’s digital restoration, which will screen at the upcoming Festival, was completed by Janus Films and the UCLA Film & Television Archive. 
“Back in 1985, when The Times of Harvey Milk screened at the first Sundance Film Festival, Frederick Wiseman, D.A. Pennebaker, and Barbara Kopple were on the jury,” said director and producer Robert Epstein. “Being in the Festival was a reward in itself, but receiving a special jury award from these legends was a young filmmaker’s dream come true. Sundance has been an important part of my life and career ever since. How great to be returning with The Times of Harvey Milk as part of the 40th Edition Celebration.”

Inspired by a real-life experience of writer-director Josh Margolin’s own centenarian grandmother, Thelma puts a clever spin on movies like Mission: Impossible, shining the spotlight on an elderly grandmother as an unlikely action hero. With affectionate humor, Margolin employs the familiar tropes of the action genre in hilarious, age-appropriate ways to tackle themes of aging, mortality, and human frailty. In the first leading film role of her over 70-year career, Oscar-nominated veteran character actor June Squibb portrays the strong-willed Thelma with grit and determination, demonstrating that she is more than capable of taking care of business — despite what her daughter Gail (Parker Posey), son-in-law Alan (Clark Gregg), or loving grandson Danny (Fred Hechinger) might believe.—BT

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6573b6108c1a1f8d3801b370,Three Seasons,40th Edition Celebration Screenings and Events,"Four ordinary people living as strangers in their own land; a young girl hired to aid a reclusive spiritual master; a cyclo driver who becomes obsessed with a proud and ambitious prostitute; a very young boy hustling lighters, gum, and cheap watches in the streets; and an American Vietnam vet searching for the daughter he never knew. Disparate lives struggling to find both place and meaning in a nation that won the war but may be losing a piece of its soul. 
With sweeping directorial vision and a powerfully poetic narrative, Tony Bui’s enormously impressive feature debut weaves together multiple stories into a striking pictorial tapestry of the “new” Vietnam, a contrast of the traditional to the modern, set within a nation in the chaotic throes of transition. As the first American film to be shot in Vietnam since the war, with a remarkable Vietnamese cast and emotionally provocative acting by the stalwart Harvey Keitel, Three Seasons achieved a pinnacle of excellence in filmmaking that was just as rare in its time as it is today.
Bui workshopped Three Seasons at the 1996 Sundance Institute’s Screenwriters and Directors Labs. Just three years later, Three Seasons went on to premiere at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival in the U.S. Dramatic Competition, where the film received widespread acclaim, earning the Excellence in Cinematography Award, and became the first feature film to win both the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award. The version screening in the upcoming Festival is a new digital restoration in 4K from the original 35mm camera negative and original master 4-track stereo. 
“After 25 years, Three Seasons comes full circle back to Sundance where it originally premiered,” said Bui. “The long and emotional journey to restore the film isn’t just about preserving the film, but about bringing it back to life to share this timeless story of love, loss, and healing after the Vietnam War for generations to come.”
Digitally restored in 4K from the original 35mm camera negative and original master 4-track stereo. Special thanks to Focus Features for permission to screen the film.

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a082ffac9f4cdaac04734,Union,U.S. Documentary Competition,"The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) — a group of current and former Amazon workers in New York City’s Staten Island — takes on one of the world’s largest and most powerful companies in the fight to unionize.
Chronicling the historic efforts of the ALU, Union is an intimate and surprising story of dogged determination, unorthodox tactics, and speaking up despite David vs. Goliath odds. Capturing up-close, in-the-trenches moments with the upstart labor union leaders — including the charismatic Chris Smalls — as they try to build support for their movement on their own terms, filmmakers Brett Story and Stephen Maing bear witness to the realities of labor organizing in the United States — challenging at best; near-impossible when facing the unlimited resources and influence of a corporate giant. They track exhilarating victories and demoralizing setbacks along the way, but foremost spotlight the far-reaching ability of collective action to inspire hope and bring self-determination to workers who’ve long felt disenfranchised and powerless.—BT

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a0365fac9f41ab9c043ec,Veni Vidi Vici,World Cinema Dramatic Competition,"The Maynards and their children lead an almost perfect billionaire family life. Amon is a passionate hunter, but doesn’t shoot animals, as the family’s wealth allows them to live totally free from consequences.
In this social satire, directors Daniel Hoesl and Julia Niemann push the rich’s untouchability to an extreme, revealing the consequences of an unchecked system and the dangers of a world where people are not accountable for their actions. The Maynards cannot be stopped, not by another man’s word, or journalistic evidence, or even the law. Now there’s only freedom: without limits and impossibilities, no matter the violence. Those with wealth are free to do as they please, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. The Machiavellian family study allows the rich to be as fearsome and violent as they pretend to be kind and giving.—AE

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fa68fac9f4522ac0337c,War Game,Special Screenings,"A bipartisan group of U.S. defense, intelligence, and elected policymakers spanning five presidential administrations participate in an unscripted role-play exercise in which they confront a political coup backed by rogue members of the U.S. military, in the wake of a contested presidential election.
Award-winning filmmakers Jesse Moss and Tony Gerber seize a unique opportunity to bring audiences tableside to a simulation that dramatically escalates the threat posed by January 6, 2021. With the grip of a thriller, War Game posits active-duty military breaking ranks to join an insurrection that soon spreads to other state capitals, yielding a chilling moment when it’s unclear whether the president fully commands the armed forces. The simulation’s outcome hinges on several inflection points, from the government’s capacity to counter the disinformation that’s effectively spread by the insurgent side to the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act (i.e., the last resort). While the exercise served to stress test our institutions, the film is a critical wake-up call, underscoring the urgent need for bipartisanship in safeguarding American democracy.—JN","Special Screenings, All Features, Drama, Nonfiction, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

Will Ferrell and Harper Steele are humorously and lovingly vulnerable in director Josh Greenbaum’s latest documentary, Will & Harper. Through the frame of a decadeslong friendship (and the windshield of Harper’s Jeep), the pair reconnect in emotional and unexpected ways as they journey across middle America. 
Layers of friendship are laid bare as Harper reenters once-safe spaces as her authentic self, reintroducing the eccentric yet earnest Will to the woman he’s always known. Their levity is reinforced and challenged: Harper embraces her newfound identity amid adversity, as Will is invited to stand by her, negotiating his celebrity in the process. What emerges is an exploration of both silliness and strife, a sincere facet of the trans experience audiences rarely witness, and an affirmation of the unbreakable bonds of friendship.—CA","Premieres, All Features, LGBTQ+ Stories, Women-Centered Stories, Comedy, Nonfiction, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/656a03cb842a921789cd371a,Winner,Premieres,"Reality Winner is a brilliant young misfit from a Texas border town who finds her morals challenged while serving as an NSA contractor. A sarcastic, gun-lovin, vegan, yogi, and CrossFit fanatic, Reality is an unconventional whistleblower who ends up being prosecuted for exposing Russia’s hacking of the 2016 election.
At once heartwarming and hard-hitting, Winner captures a depth of character, nuance of ideology, and historical detail that brings Reality Winner’s story to the screen with vibrancy and emotional thrust. Rarely can a true story be adapted so cinematically and with such fidelity to its subject matter. Weaving together the story of one unique family and a political landscape that has abandoned truth, Winner is a refreshing ode to people who have conviction and are willing to sacrifice to prove it.
Writer-director Susanna Fogel returns to the Premieres section with this tender political drama after bringing Cat Person to the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. Sundance regular Emilia Jones (star of CODA, Fairyland, and Cat Person) once again leads up Fogel’s terrific cast including Connie Britton, Zach Galifianakis, Kathryn Newton, and Danny Ramirez.—AH","Premieres, All Features, Biography, Women-Centered Stories, Action/Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fiction, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

Filmmaker Caroline Lindy invites us into the wondrous and dazzling world of her debut feature, a genre-defying monster mash that’s equal parts twisted and romantic with a dash of musical whimsy. Melissa Barrera shines as Laura, capturing her ascent from pie-eating post-surgery doldrums to empowered theater stardom in which the sinister sides of herself are finally allowed to bubble freely to the surface. In Tommy Dewey, she finds a perfect match for her fantastical, unexpected monster — charming, witty, and dangerously likable. A welcome re-steering of the rom-com into darker realms, Your Monster encourages us all to liberate our inner demons.—AS","Midnight, All Features, First-Time Features, Music Films, Women-Centered Stories, Comedy, Fiction, Horror, Romance, Closed Captioning, U.S. Only","DIRECTOR(S):

In her solo-feature directorial debut, based on her co-authored screenplay, Marie Amachoukeli displays the careful observation of a masterful auteur in how she captures both the complex situation of Gloria, called back to a family that has grown without her but needs her more than ever, and Cléo, too young and loving to say goodbye to another mother. The striking power of this beautiful film is in the loving relationship between Gloria and Cléo, made more real by the incredible performance of 6-year-old Louise Mauroy-Panzani as Cléo, who gives a nuanced performance unlike any other this year.—SS
Premiering as the opening night selection of the 2023 Semaine de la Critique at the Cannes Film Festival, àma Gloria has charmed and moved audiences around the world with its layered storytelling and extraordinary performances.
